	abstract = {The peak inelastic displacement of a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system is an efficient ground motion (GM) intensity measure (IM) for estimating seismic demands in structures and infrastructures. Most ground motion models (GMMs) that predict this IM are developed to estimate the arbitrary or geometric mean of the horizontal GM components obtained from the two as-recorded orientations. In this study, the median and maximum directional inelastic spectral displacements, denoted as Sd i,RotD50 and Sd i,RotD100 , respectively, were considered as IMs to develop GMMs. These orientation-independent measures of horizontal motion were calculated by rotating the GMs through all non-redundant rotation angles and have the advantage of removing the sensor orientation as a contributor to overall uncertainty. To do this, several SDOF systems were considered using a subset of the NGA-West2 database to fit GMMs for these IMs. A set of functional forms was developed using a mixed-effects regression approach. The predictor variables were the elastic period, T, the strength ratio, R, and a set of seismological GM causal parameters (i.e. magnitude, distance, soil condition, and so on). Comparison with existing GMMs that consider either inelastic spectral displacement or directionality is provided to highlight key differences and developments. In addition, the response directionality, defined as the ratio Sd i,RotD100 / Sd i,RotD50 , was observed to be notably impacted by the strength ratio and elastic period, which has not been discussed in the literature to date. Overall, this GMM has the advantage of quantifying ground motion intensity via an efficient IM in Sd i , which can better highlight some fundamental issues surrounding the directionality of GMs and allow for more informative risk estimates.},

	abstract = {This study evaluates the performance of a new intensity measure, referred to as filtered incremental velocity FIV3, which is computed using time-domain features extracted from an acceleration time series and is aimed at the evaluation of structural collapse. This novel approach focuses on the area under a small number of acceleration pulses in the ground motion instead of focusing on the peak response of linear elastic oscillators as in many recently proposed measures of ground motion intensity. FIV3 is developed based on previous research that has highlighted the close relation between the incremental velocity of a ground motion and its potential to induce large inelastic incursions on structures. However, unlike the original definition of incremental velocity which provides a single level of intensity for a ground motion, this new intensity measure is period-dependent and computed as the sum of the three largest incremental velocities obtained from a low-pass filtered ground acceleration time series. Efficiency and sufficiency with respect to several ground motion parameters such as magnitude, source-to-site-distance, spectral shape, scale factor, and duration are carefully evaluated and compared against those computed with some traditional and recently proposed intensity measures using collapse results from a four-story reinforced concrete frame. Results indicate that FIV3 leads to lower variability of collapse estimates and therefore higher efficiency as well as high sufficiency compared with those of other ground motion intensity parameters indicating that this new intensity measure is a promising parameter for structural collapse risk assessment.},

	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers. Seismic collapse estimations strongly depend on selecting an intensity measure that minimizes the dispersion in collapse capacities and any possible bias. This study evaluates the recently proposed Filtered Incremental Velocity (FIV3) intensity measure for estimating collapse intensities of moment-resisting-frame buildings and compares its performance with two traditional intensity measures, namely spectral acceleration at the first-mode period of the structure and spectral acceleration combined with an explicit consideration of the spectral shape proxy ϵ, and with two advanced intensity measures, namely Saavg and IMcomb. Comparisons are made using collapse results from six special moment frame buildings having 1 to 20 stories. It is shown that for buildings with periods of vibration shorter than 1 s, FIV3 provides the best overall results based on efficiency and sufficiency with respect to magnitude, distance, spectral shape, duration, and scale factor. For buildings with periods longer than 1 s, FIV3 is comparable to Saavg and IMcomb, and clearly outperforms Sa and Sa+ϵ. Based on these results, a generalization of FIV3 is proposed as an intensity measure for the seismic collapse estimation of moment frame buildings.},

@article{Tarbali2019,
abstract = {This paper focuses on the selection of ground motions for seismic response analysis in the near-fault region, where directivity effects are significant. An approach is presented to consider forward directivity velocity pulse effects in seismic hazard analysis without separate hazard calculations for ‘pulse-like' and ‘non-pulse-like' ground motions, resulting in a single target hazard (at the site of interest) for ground motion selection. The ability of ground motion selection methods to appropriately select records that exhibit pulse-like ground motions in the near-fault region is then examined. Applications for scenario and probabilistic seismic hazard analysis cases are examined through the computation of conditional seismic demand distributions and the seismic demand hazard. It is shown that ground motion selection based on an appropriate set of intensity measures (IMs) will lead to ground motion ensembles with an appropriate representation of the directivity-included target hazard in terms of IMs, which are themselves affected by directivity pulse effects. This alleviates the need to specify the proportion of pulse-like motions and their pulse periods a priori as strict criteria for ground motion selection.},

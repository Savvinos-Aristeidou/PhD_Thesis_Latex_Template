\section{Discussion and conclusions}

This study presented the empirical correlations between assorted \glspl{IM} of various types, namely \gls{PGA}, \gls{PGV}, \gls{Sa}, \gls{Ds}, \gls{Saavg}, and \gls{FIV3}. The residuals, which are used for the calculation of correlations, were obtained from a previously developed \gls{GGMM} and the same filtered ground motion database. This is believed to produce more consistent correlation coefficients since the same database subset is used for the development of the \gls{GMM} and the calculation of empirical correlation coefficients.
